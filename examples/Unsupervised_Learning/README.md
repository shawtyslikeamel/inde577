# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning refers to machine learning tasks where data does not come
with explicit labels or target values. The goal is to uncover structure in the
data, such as clusters, lower-dimensional representations, or communities.

This directory contains examples of common unsupervised learning algorithms,
including clustering methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, and
community detection algorithms.

We still *compare* clusters to the true label `tampered` afterward as a sanity check:
- Do clusters align with “tampered vs real”?
- Do clusters align with “experiment 1 vs experiment 2”?

## Algorithms

- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- PCA
- Community Detection
