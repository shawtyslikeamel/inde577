# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) for datasets used
across multiple supervised and unsupervised learning examples in this
repository.

## Purpose
The goal of this notebook is to provide a high-level understanding of the
data before applying machine learning algorithms. EDA helps identify data
structure, distributions, and potential issues such as class imbalance or
feature scaling.

## What This Notebook Covers
- Dataset loading and basic inspection
- Feature dimensions and data types
- Summary statistics
- Simple visualizations (e.g. distributions, scatter plots)

This analysis is intentionally lightweight and focused on interpretability.
