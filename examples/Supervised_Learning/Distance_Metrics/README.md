# Distance Metrics

This notebook demonstrates and explores common distance metrics used in
machine learning, with a focus on their geometric intuition and practical
behavior in low-dimensional spaces.

## Purpose
Distance metrics are a core building block for many algorithms, especially
instance-based methods such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and clustering
techniques. This notebook provides visual and numerical intuition for how
different distance functions compare points in feature space.

## Distance Metrics Covered
- Euclidean Distance (L2)
- Manhattan Distance (L1)

These metrics are implemented from scratch in the corresponding source code
module and imported here to demonstrate their correctness and usage.

## What This Notebook Shows
- How different distance metrics measure similarity between points
- Simple geometric examples illustrating each metric
- Numerical comparisons on small synthetic datasets
