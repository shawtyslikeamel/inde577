# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning refers to machine learning tasks where each example comes
with an associated label or target value. The goal is to learn a mapping from
inputs (features) to outputs (labels) so that the model can make accurate
predictions on new, unseen data.

This directory contains examples of common supervised learning algorithms
for both regression and classification, such as linear and logistic regression,
decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, and neural networks.
